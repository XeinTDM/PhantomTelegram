# PhantomTelegram

**PhantomTelegram** is a lightweight keylogger that sends captured keystrokes to a specified Telegram bot using the Telegram Bot API. It uses `rdev` for key event listening and `reqwest` for HTTP requests.

## Features
- Captures keystrokes and processes them.
- Sends the captured input to a Telegram chat in near real-time.
- Uses rate limiting to prevent spamming the Telegram bot API.
